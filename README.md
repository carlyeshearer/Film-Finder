# Film-Finder

Calling all UMBC students! Do you want to watch a movie but are too lazy to drive far and find the details? Film Finder identifies any movies playing today nearby at the time of your choice!

Our inspiration stemmed from watching Zombieland together last night. We decided on that movie because it was one of the first movies that showed up on Netflix. This realization of our laziness prompted us to make a program to help the other sluggards on campus. 

We learned how to scrape a website and use Tkinter to design GUIs, both of which were new skills. We built our project by first brainstorming and mapping out our idea. Next, we did research on how to scrape a website and programmed our code. 

When we were done relatively early, we decided to make the code more visually pleasing by using Tkinter. Learning how to use this took time and a lot of trial and error. Challenges we faced were scraping more than one website and designing our program using Tkinter.
